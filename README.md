# Object Recognition with Machine Learning
Object Recoginition is an Android application, which I created for the thesis of my degree. It uses custom machine
learning models for the image recognition trained with Google Cloud Vision API and Google's MLKit API for the object recognition
to recognize objects in a picture selected from storage, or taken with the camera app.
It has the option of choosing from three different custom trained models to recognize ordinary objects, electronic components or flowers.
